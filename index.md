# Prompting Large Language Models with Audio for General-Purpose Speech Summarization

<font size="5">Anonymous submission to Interspeech 2024</font>

## Abstract

In this work, we introduce a framework for speech summarization that leverages the processing and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We propose an end-to-end system that combines an instruction-tuned LLM with an audio encoder that converts speech into token representations that the LLM can interpret. Using a dataset with paired speech-text data, the overall system is trained to generate consistent responses to prompts with the same semantic information regardless of the input modality. The resulting framework allows the LLM to process speech inputs in the same way as text, enabling speech summarization by simply prompting the LLM. Unlike prior approaches, our method is able to summarize spoken content from any arbitrary domain, and it can produce summaries in different styles by varying the LLM prompting strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms a cascade baseline of speech recognition followed by LLM text processing.

## Contents

This page contains examples of spoken document summaries generated using the method proposed in the above paper. We provide sample summaries of articles from the CNN / DailyMail Dataset, where speech has been synthesized using a StyleTTS 2 model trained on the LJ Speech dataset, as well as examples demonstrating how varying the prompt to the LLM can produce summaries in different styles.

We also show summaries of stories spoken by actual people in "in the wild" settings, demonstrating the usability of our method in real-life scenarios.

Finally, we include examples of our system's responses to other types of spoken prompts and queries, demonstrating its ability to understand and process general speech inputs beyond those for summarization.

**All summaries shown below were generated using speech inputs.**

(CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will get two extra weeks to form a government, Israel's President said in a news release Monday. Netanyahu made the request at President Reuven Rivlin's Jerusalem home Monday. "We have made progress and are on the way to forming a government," Netanyahu told Rivlin, according to a statement. "However, I require additional time in order for the government to be stable and so that we might reach agreement on important issues that will aid us in meeting the challenges facing the State of Israel." Netanyahu must form his government in less than 42 days, according to Israeli law. "I wish you success in your work," Rivlin told the Prime Minister, according to a statement. "The entire people of Israel hope that a government will be established; indeed, a transition government has not received the confidence of the Knesset and is viewed by the public as needing to be dealt with. I hope that in the coming days you will succeed in forming a stable government for the State of Israel." Last month, Netanyahu's Likud Party snared 30 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, giving its leaders the first chance at forming a coalition government. The Zionist Union came in second, with 24 seats.
