# Prompting Large Language Models with Audio for General-Purpose Speech Summarization

<font size="5">Anonymous submission to Interspeech 2024</font>

## Abstract

In this work, we introduce a framework for speech summarization that leverages the processing and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We propose an end-to-end system that combines an instruction-tuned LLM with an audio encoder that converts speech into token representations that the LLM can interpret. Using a dataset with paired speech-text data, the overall system is trained to generate consistent responses to prompts with the same semantic information regardless of the input modality. The resulting framework allows the LLM to process speech inputs in the same way as text, enabling speech summarization by simply prompting the LLM. Unlike prior approaches, our method is able to summarize spoken content from any arbitrary domain, and it can produce summaries in different styles by varying the LLM prompting strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms a cascade baseline of speech recognition followed by LLM text processing.

## Contents

This page contains examples of spoken document summaries generated using the method proposed in the above paper. We provide sample summaries of articles from the CNN / DailyMail Dataset, where speech has been synthesized using a StyleTTS 2 model trained on the LJ Speech dataset, as well as examples demonstrating how varying the prompt to the LLM can produce summaries in different styles.

We also show summaries of stories spoken by actual people in "in the wild" settings, demonstrating the usability of our method in real-life scenarios.

Finally, we include examples of our system's responses to other types of spoken prompts and queries, demonstrating its ability to understand and process general speech inputs beyond those for summarization.

**All outputs shown below from our proposed system were generated using speech inputs.**

Juventus moved ever closer to clinching a fourth straight Serie A title by beating nearest challengers Lazio 2-0 in Turin. First-half goals from Carlos Tevez - his 26th of the season in all competitions - and centre-back Leonardo Bonucci pushed Juve 15 points clear of second place with only seven games remaining. Lazio did mount a late rally at the Juventus Stadium but the dismissal of midfielder Danilo Cataldi for a heavy tackle on Tevez ended their challenge. Carlos Tevez opened the scoring for Juventus after 17 minutes as they beat Lazio on Saturday . Tevez jumps for joy after firing Juventus ahead with his 26th goal of the season . The result brought Lazio's run of six consecutive victories to an end and the Biancocelesti could be dragged back into third place should their city rivals Roma beat Atalanta in the capital on Sunday. Earlier on Saturday, ambitious Sampdoria were held to an unlikely goalless draw by Cesena but used the point to take a share of fourth place. The Genoa club dominated their relegation-threatened opponents from start to finish but found goalkeeper Federico Agliardi an immovable object when their radar was not malfunctioning. Samp are now level on Napoli with 60 points while 18th-placed Cesena are six points shy of Atalanta and safety with seven games still to play.

(CNN)The much-discussed trailer for "Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice" just got a makeover. Soon after the trailer went up late on Friday, YouTuber Bobby Burns got to work on doing his own version using classic superhero footage. Instead of Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill facing off, this version wonders what it would be like if comics' classic characters Adam West and Christopher Reeve took their places. CNN spoke to 18-year-old Burns about what motivated him to make his now-viral video. (Warner Bros. Pictures, the studio behind "Batman v. Superman," is owned by Time Warner, as is CNN.) CNN: When did you start making YouTube videos like this? Burns: At age 11. I work for the Made In Network in Nashville, Tennessee. CNN: Where did this idea come from? Burns: I'm pretty hyped for "Batman v. Superman." As soon as I saw the trailer, my brain immediately went to the classic "Batman" [TV series] and I thought how funny it would be if this film was made at the time. CNN: What were you looking to accomplish? Burns: I wanted to contrast the old with the new. CNN: What kind of reaction have you received? Burns: Within an hour of the trailer going up, I went to work on the edit. Within four hours, my edit was finished and up on the Internet. The reaction has been great! It's awesome to see so many people enjoying what I made. Take a look at the fan trailer below: .

(CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will get two extra weeks to form a government, Israel's President said in a news release Monday. Netanyahu made the request at President Reuven Rivlin's Jerusalem home Monday. "We have made progress and are on the way to forming a government," Netanyahu told Rivlin, according to a statement. "However, I require additional time in order for the government to be stable and so that we might reach agreement on important issues that will aid us in meeting the challenges facing the State of Israel." Netanyahu must form his government in less than 42 days, according to Israeli law. "I wish you success in your work," Rivlin told the Prime Minister, according to a statement. "The entire people of Israel hope that a government will be established; indeed, a transition government has not received the confidence of the Knesset and is viewed by the public as needing to be dealt with. I hope that in the coming days you will succeed in forming a stable government for the State of Israel." Last month, Netanyahu's Likud Party snared 30 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, giving its leaders the first chance at forming a coalition government. The Zionist Union came in second, with 24 seats.

I feel like I'm living on borrowed time. I have a limited amount of savings, and probably around January or February, I won't have enough money to continue living in my apartment. And my apartment is one of the cheapest in Fayetteville. I got it six years ago, and the rent hasn't gone up too much. I rent from a private landlady. She has been pretty good through this whole pandemic. However, I'm still really worried about my future. For a really long time I was looking into buying RVs, trailers, shacks, living out of my minivan. I'm really concerned and I'm worried that nobody really understands the effect of this, like the way this is going to impact millions of people. We need more affordable housing. We need more laws that protect renters. We need to have more support for landlords. When they are struggling with tenants who can't make their rent, it's like a trickle down effect. And I think it's really important to look at this from a perspective of how can we lift everybody up rather than punish people who have been impacted by circumstances entirely out of their control. I know for me personally, thinking about this is really difficult emotionally because I don't want to lose my home, but I probably will. It's just a matter of time.

My personal experiences that was with, when I was in high school everybody wanted me to play basketball like my brother, who was a basketball star, but nobody cared what sport I really wanted to play and where my heart was and what my love was, and I relate that to, now, as I coach baseball, I see a lot of these parents, a lot of these fathers trying to live vicariously through their sons, and daughters, that they bring to play baseball, and they could care less what their child actually wants to play, and so the impact of that is these kids not putting their actual love into the sport. And, you know, it creates tension in the home because these parents are trying to live vicariously through them. And they yelling at them, being that parent that's yelling from the stands, wanting them to be a certain way. And these kids, their heart is not in it. So, I think we need to care a lot more about the mental health of these young adolescents, these young pre-teens, and see what's really on their mind. And that's my personal experience.

        I have personal experience with parents who try to force their children to play basketball, despite their children's true passions. I relate this to the current situation in baseball, where many parents push their children to play baseball, even if their children don't have a love for the sport. This creates tension at home, as parents try to live by their expectations and yell at their children if they don't perform well. I believe we need to care more about the mental health of these young athletes and provide them with the necessary support and guidance to help them find their passion. It's important to remember that this is a common experience, and it's essential to understand and empathize with the struggles that young athletes face.
